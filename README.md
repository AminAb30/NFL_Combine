# NFL_Combine
In the National Football League (NFL), athletes exhibit a remarkable range of physical attributes tailored to the demands of their positions. Every year, the NFL Combine collects physical and performance data from new athletes declaring for the NFL draft. Scouts use this data to further evaluate player prospects beyond their on-field performances.
